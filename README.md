# Personal_Website
While creating a personal website, the first thing I have gone is added files that is recommended.
Second, I started creating 5 branches that I can just merge. 
Later I started looking up how to add links where when a user clicks on a link it will take them to another website. The only thing that I am struggling with a little bit is on the portfolio branch. 
Other than that I have added css styles to not make my website look boring
